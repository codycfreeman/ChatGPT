<h2>ASKING FOR HELP</h2>
<p>When we reach out for help, we join a fellowship built on trust and mutual support. This connection is vital to recovery and keeps us grounded in the principles of the program.</p>
<p>By sharing our experiences, we open the door to honesty and healing. These daily reflections remind us that together we can do what we could not do alone.</p>
